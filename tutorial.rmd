## Tutorial
This is an shiny app created for the final project of Coursera course "Developing Data Products". It is a predictor for diamond prices based on a trained model from the dataset "diamonds". For the training of the model, 500 samples from the dataset has been used. The machine learning algorithm used is the "random forrest" method.

Before using the predictor, the user needs to train the predicting model by clicking "Train my model". After the training is finished, the user needs to specify the 4 properties of the diamond, which are the cut, color, clarity, and the carat(weight). After specifying these parameters, click "Price my diamond" to display the predicted price for the diamond.  

Have fun!
